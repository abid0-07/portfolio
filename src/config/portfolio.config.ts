  // About Information
  about: {
    bio: "I’m Abdullah Al Abid, an Information Security Executive with a strong technical background in web development, software engineering, and data-driven solutions. Currently, I work as part of a team of security professionals to address and mitigate cybersecurity challenges in Mobile Financial Services (MFS). My technical expertise includes JavaScript, TypeScript, and modern web technologies, with a focus on building clean, scalable, and efficient applications. I also have hands-on experience with Java, Python, and C#, which I’ve used for developing robust software solutions and exploring machine learning applications. I am comfortable working with databases such as MongoDB, SQL, and Prisma, enabling me to design reliable and high-performance data systems. Beyond development, I have a strong interest in data analysis and analytics. I’ve applied statistical and analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights from data and enjoy creating impactful visual narratives using tools like Google Looker Studio and IBM Cognos Analytics. Additionally, I have worked on machine learning projects including protein prediction and heart disease prediction. Currently, I am deepening my expertise in cybersecurity, with a particular focus on application security, information security practices, and protecting digital financial platforms. Driven by curiosity and a continuous learning mindset, I am always eager to explore emerging technologies, solve real-world problems, and create meaningful impact through secure and innovative solutions.",
